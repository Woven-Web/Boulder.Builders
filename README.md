# Boulder.Builders - Build a Better Boulder, Together

## Vision

Boulder.Builders is a community platform designed to foster a more connected, resilient, and innovative Boulder community by providing a dedicated platform for open collaboration on local challenges and opportunities.

Our goal is to connect three key elements:
- **People** - Residents, students, entrepreneurs, community organizers, and anyone with a connection to Boulder
- **Problems** - Community-identified challenges and inquiries approved for collaborative exploration
- **Projects** - Initiatives and solutions emerging from problem discussions

## Current Status: Work in Progress

**This project is in early development.** Everything in this repository is likely to change significantly as we build toward our vision. We're currently working on:

1. Building a strong foundation for the platform
2. Implementing the core collaboration workflows
3. Designing an intuitive, accessible interface
4. Testing different approaches to community engagement

## Core Concepts

### The P-P-P (People-Problems-Projects) Map

The central organizing principle for visualizing our ecosystem:
- **People**: Opted-in participants showcasing their involvement and skills
- **Problems**: Community-identified challenges or inquiries for collaborative exploration
- **Projects**: Formalized initiatives or solutions emerging from problem discussions
- **Connections**: Visualizing the relationships between these entities

### Open Contribution ("Commons")

Contributions (ideas, research, mockups, etc.) shared within the "Problem Collaboration" spaces are explicitly understood to be offered under an open license to encourage building upon each other's work without ownership friction in the early stages.
