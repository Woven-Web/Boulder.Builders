# Boulder Builders

Where community meets technology.

## About

Boulder Builders is a community of Boulderites gathering to build solutions for our city. Through collaborative design sessions, we explore local challenges and create togetherâ€”with technology as our tool and community as our strength.

### Our Principles

- **Give First** - We show up to support one another
- **Start Small** - Simple solutions first, building incrementally

## Development

This is a simple React landing page built with Vite and TypeScript.

### Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at http://localhost:5173/

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Deploy

The built files will be in the `dist` directory, ready to deploy to any static hosting service.
